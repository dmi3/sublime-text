# log.sublime-syntax

Highlight log files for better readability. Tested with log4j. Should support any other log formats also, since highlights generic words like Error, Exception etc (see source to highlight more words).

TIP: for better log analysis install [FilterPipes](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FilterPipes) which allows you to quickly execute grep on logs and more.
